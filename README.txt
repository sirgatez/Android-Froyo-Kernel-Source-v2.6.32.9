HOW TO BUILD KERNEL 2.6.32 FOR GT-I9000

1. Visit http://www.codesourcery.com/, download and install Sourcery G++ Lite 2009q3-68 toolchain for ARM EABI.

2. Extract kernel source and move into the top directory.

3. Execute 'make aries_eur_defconfig'.

4. Execute 'make' or 'make -j<n>' where '<n>' is the number of multiple jobs to be invoked simultaneously.

	arch/arm/boot/zImage
	net/netfilter/xt_TCPMSS.ko
	drivers/onedram_svn/modemctl/modemctl.ko
